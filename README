q-dhcp-client - dhcp client with just 28K size

Compilation:
1)Edit Makefile to satisfy your requirements and tools
2)Execute make
Install in any place by moving/copying ./q-dhcp-client

Usage options:
-d - show debug info
-i <interface name> - specify interface to work with
--dry - do not edit interface ip, mask and routes
--arp-check - perform arp check after receiving DHCP_OFFER
send DHCP_DECLINE if dhcp client receives ARP_REPLY
--release - send DHCP_RELEASE to free current ip

Return values:
0 - OK
-1 - Internal error
-2 - IP already occupied or got DHCP_NAK
Without -d prints lease time in seconds
So you can do LEASE_TIME=$(q-dhcp-client ...)
And use it to set cron job or any timer

Examples:
#Get ip addr, perform arp check
#Set ip addr, net mask and default route for device eth0 if ip is free
q-dhcp-client -i eth0 --arp-check

#Get ip and set ip, mask and route
q-dhcp-client -i eth0

#Send DHCP_RELEASE and delete ip addr from device
q-dhcp-client -i eth0 --release

#Get ip(without setting it in device) and print debug info
q-dhcp-client -i eth0 --dry -d


I use it for my LFS build with runit
